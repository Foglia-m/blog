        <p>Implementing an android version was surprisingly easy in terms of Unity build as it&rsquo;s cross platform philosophy is definitely a great asset for developpers.
Therfore, I followed the lab explanation and could run the game on my android phone (I had already coded android apps so it was even more intuitive to me) but as a novice, you have documentation to help you, as a developer, you&rsquo;re never alone.</p>
<p>The user&rsquo;s input part is somehow more complex and I got error I couldn&rsquo;t really deal with: my accelerometer wasn&rsquo;t giving any values and the ground transform value couldn&rsquo;t be modified as my script had non definition for transform which was supposed to be the ground transform.
Therefore my game could run but I had no Input and didn&rsquo;t manage to understand why.</p>
<p>This is a screenshot of my game:
