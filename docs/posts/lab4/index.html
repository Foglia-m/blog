        <p>I managed to make things work as this footage shows:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I had few access to the VR lab because of the COVID so I could not fix some issues: mainly the offset of the object when you grab it in VR.</p>
<p>But the main issue with this is that I followed the guidelines with interest but couldn&rsquo;t come up with any critical vision on what I was doing because I had so few experience in what I was doing, it was the first I coded anything in VR but it felt way more magical than everything I had done on Unity before, the main reason is that you import many packages because building everything from scratch must be a nightmare. It was a long process but it ended up working by following closely every step so that&rsquo;s my best advice when you work on something you don&rsquo;t know well technically : follow each steps carefully.
Still I think the integration of my game to the VR environment went smoother than expected and I thought it would be the other way around (importing VR controls to the game) so that shows how VR is compatible with unity development. However, the simplicity of roll a ball definitely helps there.</p>
<p>Some issues I encoutered:
Camera offset issue: I couldn&rsquo;t change the main camera position in the beginning so I had to move back 1m de have the board in front of me.</p>
<p>Grabbing Offset Issue: As we see in the gameplay footage, there is a snap offset when you grab the board,

<p>I tried to fix it by following this thread but the result was not there and I couldn&rsquo;t access the lab anymore but I think the solution is there.</p>
