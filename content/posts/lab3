Implementing an android version was surprisingly easy in terms of Unity build as it's cross platform philosophy is definitely a great asset for developpers. 
Therfore, I followed the lab explanation and could run the game on my android phone (I had already coded android apps so it was even more intuitive to me) but as a novice, you have documentation to help you, as a developer, you're never alone.

The user's input part is somehow more complex and I got error I couldn't really deal with: my accelerometer wasn't giving any values and the ground transform value couldn't be modified as my script had non definition for transform which was supposed to be the ground transform.
Therefore my game could run but I had no Input and didn't manage to understand why.

This is a screenshot of my game:
