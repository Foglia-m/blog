Tried to add some football gameplay in it but I was too short on time to deliver a true experience, moreover, these basic capsule colliders are awful for this kind of application but were mandatory for the exercice, I'll try to use custom colliders (not mesh though) in the future that suit the player leg's animation to have something better.
I eventually tried adjusting the bounciness combine (make it multiply/ maximum instead of average) of the ball and it was somehow more realitic and fun bun the normal vector of the capsule collider is juste too random to work correctly with a huge bouncing effect.

It was a lot of fun to create this game and I hope I'll have time to make others in the future.

Peace.
