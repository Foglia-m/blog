I had to create a character, create a rig (It's a very long process, I'd advise using premade rigs for humanoids) and animate it.

In order to get comfortable with Blender's UI (mostly its shortkeys and multiple windows) and 3d modelling in general, I created a Koons dog first. It was quite fast to do and the result are not that bad so I'm sure more time spent on it can make it quite descent for a video game or 3D use.

Then I started working on my character, it's a whole different perspective since humanoids must really follow a defined sketch, importing my drawing on two axis, I could follow the lines and make it a 3D character, it was quite tricky to handle all the finishing on polygons (making them smooth and realistic). 
Still, I managed to modelize something correct for the body and decided to go rogue on the helmet because yes, a great helmet is the only thing that makes a villain look great (take Dark Vader or Kylo Ren for instance, Vader is not a villain as soon as his mask goes off and Kylo is... well he is becoming more Adam Sandler than Kylo Ren to be honest).
So back to the helmet, the goal here was inspired by a mix between a kobra shaped structure and a futuristic kind of android helmet. I do like the result and I advise to try to play around with uncommon shapes. Technically, it basically means extruding and playing around with symetries in "unconventional" ways and accepting results that look strange at first sight, because, as long as you keep your global picture, you're getting to what you like and you feel like you've created something unique.

Whith all that said, here is the result:
